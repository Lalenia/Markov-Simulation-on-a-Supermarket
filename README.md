## Markov-Simulation-on a Supermarket

Program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket (Monte Carlo Markov Chain Simulations)

First an in depth EDA was conducted on the given data and then transition probabilities where calculated. After classes were implemnted so as to run a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain simulation for multiple customers for a single day using the generated transition probabilities matrix.
